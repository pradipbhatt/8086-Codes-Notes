<h1>8086 Coding Problems in Microprocessor</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the realm of microprocessor programming, working with the 8086 architecture can present its own set of challenges. However, with the right tools, you can overcome these hurdles and effectively run your 8086 assembly code. This README will guide you through the process of running your 8086 assembly code using two commonly used software: 8086 emulator and DOSBox.</p>

<h2>Running Code with 8086 Emulator</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install an 8086 emulator such as "emu8086" or "DOSBox Turbo" on your system.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch the 8086 emulator software.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Open the emulator and create a new project or file to write your 8086 assembly code.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Write your assembly code using a suitable text editor within the emulator.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Save your assembly code file with a <code>.asm</code> extension.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Assemble and compile your code within the emulator software.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once the assembly process completes successfully, run the code using the emulator's built-in debugger or execution features.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 8</strong>: Debug and analyze your code as needed, leveraging the emulator's debugging capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 9</strong>: Make any necessary modifications to your code, reassemble, and re-run it in the emulator until your desired output is achieved.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Running Code with DOSBox</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Install DOSBox on your system if you haven't already.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch DOSBox.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Mount the directory containing your 8086 assembly code using the appropriate DOSBox command.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Change the directory to the location of your assembly code file within DOSBox.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Use the appropriate 8086 assembler and linker commands to assemble and compile your code within DOSBox.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Once the assembly process completes successfully, run the compiled executable within DOSBox to execute your 8086 assembly code.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 7</strong>: Analyze the output and debug any issues using available tools and techniques within DOSBox.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 8</strong>: Make any necessary modifications to your code, reassemble, and re-run it in DOSBox until your desired output is achieved.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following the steps outlined above, you can effectively run your 8086 assembly code using either the 8086 emulator or DOSBox. The emulator provides a more user-friendly and efficient environment for running your code, whereas DOSBox serves as a viable alternative when an emulator is not readily available. Feel free to explore both options and choose the one that suits your needs best.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Remember to always exercise caution and backup </p>
